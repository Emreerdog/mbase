===========================
About Single-Prompt Example
===========================

In this example, we will write a program that will read user input (prompt in our context)
from stdin and supply it to the LLM. Then, the LLM will give the response.

It may look complex at first and the explanations may be dull.
The reason for that is to keep the examples short and to the point.
