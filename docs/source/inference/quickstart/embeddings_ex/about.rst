About Retrieval Example
=======================

In this example, we will write a program that will read a user query and
generate embeddings using an open-source LLM model.

-------------------
What will you learn
-------------------

After you finish this example, you will learn:

* How to download and access to open-source embedder models.
* Initializing and running embedder models.
* How the embedder works in general.
