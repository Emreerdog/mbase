Preparing Windows
=================

Since in windows most things are installed using installers, you need to download the installers from their corresponding websites.

- For MSVC C++ build tools, make sure to have a Visual Studio in your environment. You can download it `here <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/>`_ .
- For CMake, you can download it from `here <https://cmake.org/download/>`_.
- For Git, you can download it from `here <https://git-scm.com/downloads/win>`_.
- For CUDA Toolkit, you can download it from `here <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_.

When it comes to uuid, it is not necessary to download anything because uuid functionality comes with the Windows SDK.

After you download and install all those softwares, make sure they are properly set.
Next, we will build the MBASE library.
