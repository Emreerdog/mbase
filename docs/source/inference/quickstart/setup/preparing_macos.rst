- Make sure you have the XCode and its command line tools are installed. You can install it from `Mac App Store <https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835>`_.

To install cmake:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    brew install cmake

To install git:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install git

After you download and install all those softwares, make sure they are properly set.
Next, we will build the MBASE library.
