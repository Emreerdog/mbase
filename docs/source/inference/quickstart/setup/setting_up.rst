==========
Setting-up
==========

In this section, you will setup your environment to develop LLM applications using MBASE Inference library.

By the end of it, you will achieve the following:

* Setting up your system.
* Installing the awesome `llama.cpp <llama.cpp_>`_ library.
* Installing the `MBASE <mbase_main_>`_ library.
* Creating an empty project and query your hardware information using `MBASE <mbase_main_>`_ library.

We will start by acknowledging the :doc:`system requirements<requirements>`.
And then there is the simple download page for fast downloading. Then, preparing the environment for SDK development.
Then, optional compiling from source and creating an empty project.
