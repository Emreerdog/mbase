From now on, you may refer to :doc:`../information_reference` in order to understand and implement advanced
features using the MBASE MCP SDK. 

MCP is an actively evolving protocol, with new features likely to be introduced in the near future.
Although the fundamental features seem to be matured, minor changes to their usage and API are highly expected.

For that reason, I will give you some MCP related resources to help you keep up with the latest changes and 
news about the MCP protocol.
