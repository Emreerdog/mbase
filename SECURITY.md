This is a security notice proclaimed by the developers of MBASE for the users of the SDKs and programs that are provided
by the MBASE Yazılım A.Ş. (https://www.mbasesoftware.com) in order to maintain the quality and safety of our and your software.

## SDK Usage Considerations

First, since the MBASE SDK is primarily developed for C++ developers to easily integrate LLMs into their high-performance
applications, the qualifications below are assumed to be present on the users of the SDK:

- An extensive experience with C++.
- A solid understanding of computer architecture.
- Knowledge of secure coding practices to reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities.
- Solid foundation in core computer science concepts.

The language of the "MBASE Software Documentation" assumes the qualifications above.

Secondly, the developer should program and integrate accordingly by understanding how MBASE SDK handles non-blocking behaviors and
how the SDK behaves in general to avoid common errors and the developer shouldn't hesistate to refer to "MBASE Software Documentation" when things go astray.

## Executable Programs Usage Considerations

There are both example and utility programs written using MBASE SDK for developers, contributors and non-developer users.

Those programs will always be properly documented under the "MBASE Software Documentation" center. The program will also prints 
its usage if the user incorrectly calls the executable program.
