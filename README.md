MBASE SDK is a set of mostly LLM related libraries actively being maintained and developed by M. Emre Erdog
and the [MBASE Yazılım A.Ş.](<https://mbasesoftware.com>) 

The main purpose of the MBASE SDK is to supply the developer with necessary tools and procedures to easily integrate LLM capabilities into their
C++ applications.

Here is a list of libraries in the MBASE SDK:

- [Inference Library](https://docs.mbasesoftware.com/inference/about.html): An LLM inference library built over https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp library for integrating LLMs into programs.
- [Model Context Protocol Library](https://docs.mbasesoftware.com/mcp/about.html): A C++ MCP client/server library that includes all fundamental features, with support for both STDIO and StreamableHTTP transport methods.
- [Standard Library](https://docs.mbasesoftware.com/std/index.html): A standard library containing STL compatible containers with default serialization support and useful utilities such as built-in uuid generation, timers etc.
- [JSON Library](https://docs.mbasesoftware.com/json/index.html): A light-weight json library.
